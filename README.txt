sent2wordbyword.R

This R function will take an input file that contains a data frame that includes full
sentences in one column, associated target words in another column, and any
number of other associated columns. The sentences are split into separate
columns by word, and the target word of the sentence is placed in its own target 
column. This segmenting is useful for rapid serial visual presentation or self-
paced reading experiments.
